## Description
___
 This Project is going to be a place where people can share music that they enjoy and find new music to listen to. The page will intitially load onto a page with genre's listed. Clicking on the genres will pull up a list of coresponding artists and clicking on an artist will pull up a list of their songs. This will help you discover new things to listen to! The main page will also have a search form to look for artists and songs. You'll also be able to add Songs and Artists to bring more noteriety to them. I hope also implement a way for users to leave comments on artists and song pages. A like/dislike feature is also on my todo list after i hit MVP.
